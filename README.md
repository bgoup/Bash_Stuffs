# Just a Bunch of Scripts

What:
----
A simple collection of scripts I have written for myself.

Why:
----
1. I'm lazy.
2. Automate all the things.
3. goto #1

Scripts:
----
* *diskhelper.sh* Interactive bash script to perform basic disk-level tasks.
* *diskmnt2target.bat* Built to work around [Portable-VirtualBox](http://www.vbox.me/) not being entirely portable for recent versions of [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 
(differing drive letters cause all VMs/disks/images to become inaccessible.)
* *backup.sh* Personal bash script which mounts a removable disk partition by label, backups files from SMB mounts, and logs the result to a simple text file with time stamp .
* *vm_basics.sh* Personal bash script which I use for seting up software and basic OS config on debain vms. .
